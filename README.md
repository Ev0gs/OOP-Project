# POO-Project

This project is my first Object-oriented programming (OOP) project which consist of connecting to a MySQL database, get data, modify data, insert data and delete data. For this project I needed to make some conceptual analysis as well as some conception models for the database I had to create. Finally, the application is maybe not very reusable because of the fact that it only connect to your database if you modify code to put your identifiers, but I am proud of it so here is my reason.
